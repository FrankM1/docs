If you're having trouble with running Qazana, here's a quick guide to resolving almost any problem.


## Search the docs

We heavily document all of the most common problems which people have running Qazana, so chances are if you search these docs for your error message or keyphrase then you'll find a page about it! Our search spans a massive archive of content to try and find exactly what you're looking for.


## Qazana(Pro) email support

If you're having trouble with a **Qazana(Pro)** site, just drop us an email on `support@qazana.net` and we'll be more than happy to help. Direct email support from the creators of Qazana is one of the benefits of our fully managed platform.

If you're not a **Qazana(Pro)** customer, there are still plenty of ways to get help:

### The Qazana forum

You'll find a large community of developers and users on [the Qazana Forum](https://forum.qazana.net) who are generally very helpful to each other in resolving common issues. It's worth searching here, too, to check if your question has already been answered. If not, feel free to open a new topic and see if anyone can give you a hand.


### Issues with 3rd party services

If you're having trouble with a 3rd party service such as Disqus comments, a specific hosting provider, or an external mail service: **Try contacting them directly for support, first**. We generally aren't able to solve or even diagnose issues in other products, because we don't have any access to their systems, data, or infrastructure.

If you exhaust all support avenues and still need help, you can always post on the forum and see if anyone else might have experienced the same issue. However, it shouldn't be your first port of call.
